## Introduction

Welcome to the sciprog_24 repository, created for my Git Assignment Project at ICHEC (Irish Centre for High-End Computing) during the 2024-2025 academic year. This repository serves as the central hub for my practical assignments, showcasing my proficiency in scientific programming, primarily using the C programming language.

Each assignment is maintained in a separate branch, providing a structured and organized workflow. This structure not only facilitates version control but also ensures a clear record of progress, code development, and validation.


Hereâ€™s an updated version with additional elements to enhance clarity and utility, including prerequisites, expected outcomes, and contribution guidelines:

Introduction
Welcome to the sciprog_24 repository, created for my Git Assignment Project at ICHEC (Irish Centre for High-End Computing) during the 2024-2025 academic year. This repository serves as the central hub for my practical assignments, showcasing my proficiency in scientific programming, primarily using the C programming language.

Each assignment is maintained in a separate branch, providing a structured and organized workflow. This structure not only facilitates version control but also ensures a clear record of progress, code development, and validation.

## Project Structure
The repository is designed for clarity and modularity, with assignments categorized into distinct branches. Here's how the structure is organized:

## Branch Overview:
### Main Branch:
Contains general project documentation, including this README.md file, and any overarching resources or notes.

### Practical Branches:
* Each assignment is managed on a branch named practical<number> and includes:
    * Source Code: C language implementation files (e.g., main.c).
    * Documentation: A README.md file with detailed instructions on setup, execution, and expected outcomes.
 
## Example Structure:
### For Practical Assignment 2:
practical-2/
  * README.md       # Instructions for running and understanding Practical 2
  * main.c          # Implementation of Practical 2
  * additional.c    # Any supporting files (if applicable)

## Prerequisites
Before working with this repository, ensure you have the following installed and set up:

### Development Environment:
A Unix-like system (Linux/macOS) or Windows with a Unix shell (e.g., WSL or Git Bash).
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed for compiling C programs.

### Git: 
Installed and configured to clone, pull, and manage repository branches.

### Basic Knowledge:
Familiarity with terminal commands, Git operations, and the C programming language.


How to Run Each Practical
To run a practical assignment, follow these general steps:
Each `README.md` file in the practical branches provides clear instructions on:  
1. **Compiling the Code**:  
   Using the `gcc` compiler to build the program, including any necessary flags or additional source files.  
   gcc -o program_name main.c (single file execution)
   gcc -o program_name main.c additional.c (multiple file execution)

2. **Running the Executable**:  
   Steps to execute the compiled program, with details on required inputs or arguments.
   ./program_name  

3. **Verifying the Output**:  
   Guidance to compare the program's output with expected results, including sample inputs, expected outputs, and troubleshooting tips.

## Summary
This repository is a testament to my journey through scientific programming concepts and practical problem-solving in C. By leveraging Git and proper version control, I aim to maintain a professional and organized workflow throughout this academic year.

Feel free to explore, test, and review the code to gain insights into each practical assignment.
